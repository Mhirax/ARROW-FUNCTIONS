//INTRO TO ARROW FUNCTION 
// it is a new and mordern syntax for writing and defining the function expression..

const square = ( x ) => { 
     return  x * x ;
 }

const sum = ( x, y ) => {  
       return x + y ;
}


//we always store our arrow function in variable first

//They are not supported in internet explorer which is common for new features 

//Arrow functions are especially useful when passing a function as an argument, such as to the mapfunction.

//Declaring a random number between 1 - 6

// const rollDie = ( ) =>  {
// return  Math.floor (Math.random ( ) * 6) + 1
